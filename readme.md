# eClinic LRAS (Laboratory Result Automation System)


## Introduction

This documentation would provide a comprehensive guide on setting up and using the laboratory data transmission hardware we built. The hardware facilitates the direct transmission of lab data results via HL7 to the eClinic hospital information management software over the LAN.

## Hardware Use Requirement

- Keep power level at a maximum of 5V AV/DC power to run the LRAS hardware
- Carefully attach LAN cable to the LRAS hardware to avoid destroying ports
- Keep the LRAS hardware in a cool dry place (avoid moist environment)

## Software Specifications

- Description of the eClinic software and its role in managing lab data.
- C++ Boost Library

## System Architecture

- Overview of the system architecture, illustrating how the hardware interacts with laboratory machines and eClinic.

1. The LRAS hardware exposes an HL7 unidirectional receiver, which waits for data transmission from a URIT BH-5100 machine .
2. The LRAS hardware uses the test ID, embedded in the name parameter of the test (inputted by the lab scientist), to get the request token.   
3. The LRAS hardware then fetches the test and maps the parameters returned by the URIT BH-5100 machine with the parameters available for the test on eClinic software.

## HL7 Integration

- **Explanation of HL7:** Health Level Seven (HL7) is a widely used standard for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. It plays a crucial role in facilitating interoperability among different healthcare systems.

- **Significance in Healthcare Data Exchange:** HL7 ensures that health information can be shared seamlessly between various healthcare applications, devices, and systems. This standardized format improves communication and reduces errors in the transmission of clinical and administrative data.

- **HL7 Version:** The laboratory data transmission hardware in this setup utilizes HL7 version 1.1 for the exchange of lab data results. This version adheres to specific messaging standards and structures defined by HL7.

- **Generation and Transmission of HL7 Messages:** The hardware is designed to generate HL7 messages based on the 1.1 version specifications. These messages encapsulate relevant lab data results and are transmitted securely over the LAN to the eClinic hospital information management software.

- **HL7 Profiles:** Any specific HL7 profiles implemented in this integration are tailored to the requirements of the eClinic software and the laboratory machines involved in the data transmission process.

Please refer to the [HL7 Version 1.1 Documentation](https://github.com/nsisongltd/eClinic-LARS/blob/main/hl7/ANSI_HL7_EHR-S%20FM_R2.1_2020JUN_FM.pdf) for detailed information on the specifications and standards followed in this integration.
